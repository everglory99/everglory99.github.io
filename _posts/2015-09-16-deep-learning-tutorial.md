##Deep Learning Tutorials in The Climate Corporation
During the summer of 2015, I was a machine learning researcher intern at geospatial group in [The Climate Corporation](https://www.climate.com/). I was honored to give a series of deep learning tutorials to a large group of research scientists in TCC which includes statisticians, machine learning researchers, remote sensing scientists, and other domain scientists across meteorology, climatology and agriculture. I am sharing the slides and ipython notebook demos for the first tutorial in this seriers.

##Tutorial slide
In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing, and have become a dominant theme throughout machine learning, even generating excitement in the popular press.The goal of this tutorial is to make the use of modern deep architectures transparent and their results interpretable,rather than black boxes. [The tutorial slide](http://everglory99.github.io/Intro_DL_TCC/) summarizes most of the key points in modern deep learning research from model structure to numeric optimization. It also analyzes the reason why deep learning is so useful and powerful in computer vision using many concreate examples.

##Tutorial demos
There are three ipython notebook demos associated with this tutorial. [R-CNN demo](http://everglory99.github.io/Intro_DL_TCC/RCNN_demo/) illustrates the state-of-the-art image detector using open source deep learning framework [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). [Google deep dream demo](http://everglory99.github.io/Intro_DL_TCC/DeepDream_demo/) replicates the results discussed in [Google research blog](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html), it lets you "see" what is going on when neural network gets deeper and deeper. Lastly, [convolution demo](http://everglory99.github.io/Intro_DL_TCC/Conv_demo/) demonstrates one of the most important concepts in image processing field -- convolution. This is the basic to understand convolution neural network in depth. All the materials presented here are self-contained, and no previous deep learning background is required. Please let me know if you have any question.
