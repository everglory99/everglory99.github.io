I am a second year graduate student in Department of Statistics,
University of Washington, Seattle.  I focus on machine learning, in
particular the development and application of deep learning in
computer vision and computational biology. I am advised by
[Dr. William Noble](http://noble.gs.washington.edu/) (Genome Science
and Computer Science and Engineering) and
[Dr. Jeff Bilmes](http://melodi.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/pgs/index.html)
(Electronic Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering).
